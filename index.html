Parents are not taught about them and often feel lost and confused as to how to help their children. In the light of the growing trend of antisocial behavior, addiction, suicide and mental health issues among school children, it is not enough for the government to take steps to help them. It is imperative for parents, teachers, psychologists and other mentors to pitch in and give children the tools and resources they need to navigate their world and create their space in it. We provide a platform for children to receive the support and the care that they need to grow up into happy, healthy and pro-social adults.">
